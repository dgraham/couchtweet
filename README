== Welcome to CouchTweet

CouchTweet is an example Rails web application that makes learning about
Apache CouchDB and the CouchRest Ruby gem easier.  It uses Twitter's data
model and website as a template.  Because CouchDB is a distributed key/value
database, CouchTweet can scale across many servers or run on just a single
laptop.  We can use CouchDB Lounge to build a cluster of CouchTweet nodes for
high traffic load tests.

== Getting Started

1. Start CouchDB.
2. cd couchtweet
3. Run lib/init.rb to populate CouchDB with some initial documents (users,
   tweets, followers, etc.)
4. Run script/server to start Rails.
5. Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.
6. Sign in with user_1 and "user_1 password".
7. Take a peek at lib/views.rb for some hints on map/reduce view design.
